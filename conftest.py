# Global mocks have been disabled as the environment has all dependencies installed.
# Previously, this file mocked mne, captum, and torch, which caused import errors.

# import sys
# from unittest.mock import MagicMock
# import numpy as np

# # Mock mne to avoid import errors globally
# if "mne" not in sys.modules:
#     pass
