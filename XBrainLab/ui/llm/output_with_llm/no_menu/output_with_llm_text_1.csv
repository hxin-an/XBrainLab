Can you segment the data into trials?,"{""text"": ""Which event label should I use to create the epochs?""}","[{'text': 'Yes, you can segment the data into trials by dividing it into different time intervals based on the event related to the EEG signal.

Do epoching please,"{""text"": ""What event do you want to epoch the data on?""}","[{'text': 'Sure, you can perform epoching by selecting a specific segment of continuous EEG data for each trial.

Can you do epoch segmentation,"{""text"": ""Which event should the data be segmented by?""}","[{'text': 'Yes, the software can perform epoch segmentation by dividing the continuous EEG data into smaller segments called epochs. Each epoch represents a specific time interval in the data.'}]",0.56
