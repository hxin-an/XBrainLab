Do epoching please,"{""text"": ""What event do you want to epoch the data on?""}","[{'text': ""Sure, you can perform epoching before training. Epoching involves dividing the continuous EEG data into smaller segments called epochs. Each epoch represents a specific time interval, and the model is trained on each epoch independently before moving on to the next one. This process helps to reduce the impact of noise and artifacts on the model's performance and improves thegeneralizability of the trained model.""}]",0.84
