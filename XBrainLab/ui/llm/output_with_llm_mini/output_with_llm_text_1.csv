The software offers various tools and methods for visualizing EEG signals, including saliency maps, topographic maps, and 3D saliency plots. These tools help you identify areas of increased and decreased activity in the brain, which can provide insights into the underlying cognitive processes.\n\n\n* **Chunk 18**: This section provides a comprehensive overview of EEG research, including statistics, methodologies, and data analysis techniques. It also includes a wealth of resources, such as handbooks, journal papers, and conference presentations, that researchers can use to learn more about EEG research.\n\n\n* **Additional Notes**: The software also provides a wealth of information about the EEG signals, including their physiological basis, different recording techniques, and clinical applications.
