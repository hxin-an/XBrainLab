## Active

## Module-by-module quality baseline

User approved the complete modular cleanup plan and requested implementation on 2026-09-10.
Earlier PR #131 acceptance is historical; it does not approve this stage's source or merge.

### Outcome and scope

Establish a reliable, understandable baseline by deleting historical overdesign, duplicated work and
unnecessary waits. Audit all tracked production, tests, scripts, dependencies, development configuration
and docs. File/LOC/test counts are inventory, not proof of quality or completion.

Preserve visible UI behavior, Command/query/Assistant public contracts, EEG semantics, settings,
recipes and existing result reading. Behavior-preserving UI internals are explicitly authorized.
Unused Python convenience APIs may be removed after checking dynamic registration, configuration,
scripts and documentation. Preserve necessary safety, cancellation, publication and consistency.
No feature/UI redesign, architecture rewrite, model/prompt/RAG experiment, new control plane,
new environment, WSL compaction, backup deletion or unrelated local cleanup.

The user additionally confirmed large-file and code-quality assessment: inspect mixed responsibilities,
coupling, duplicated branches, typing diagnostics and test effectiveness, not only physical LOC. Record
before/after evidence for changes; splitting a file or improving a number alone is not closure.
Previously authorized withdrawal of WSL-compaction tooling and exact residual cleanup remains a
separate infrastructure task; do not restart compaction/shutdown or mix destructive cleanup into
product refactor commits. Revalidate exact targets and active use before that task executes.

### Stage integration exception

One integration branch/PR contains small independently reversible commits, reviewed by module.
The user explicitly approved accumulated stage-level diff and one final Windows manual acceptance;
this stage does not require a PR/manual merge per slice. Slice-level complexity review still applies:
record deletion candidates, owner delta, production +/-/net LOC and split any oversized coherent slice.
This exception does not weaken CI, data/native/Assistant evidence or exact-source merge approval.

Use the existing Windows environment and model/data caches. Preserve the original checkout's dirty
UI/test files and root settings. Worktree/branch/source facts come from Git, not historical paths.

### Module order and ownership

| Module | Includes | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 Command/state spine | Admission, capabilities, confirmation, publication, owned work, shared domain ports | Responsibility review closed at 1247cf7c; native 178 passed; domain branches explicitly remain modules 2–6 |
| 2 Import/interpretation | Loaders, BIDS, labels/classes, channel/montage, metadata, recipes, related UI | 2A–2N reviewed; remaining domain/UI audit open |
| 3 Preprocess/epoch/split | Processing, copies, invalidation, preview/materialization, related UI/tools | Pending |
| 4 Models/training | Catalog, resource preflight, settings, stop/rerun, history/checkpoints | Pending |
| 5 Evaluation/saliency/views | Read/publication, SmoothGrad/recompute, four views, stale work/render lifecycle | Pending |
| 6 Assistant/chat | Tool adapters, turns/confirmation/execution, model/RAG lifecycle and shutdown | Pending |
| 7 Shared desktop/runtime | Shell/navigation, shared components, configuration, errors/logging/start/close | Pending |
| 8 Scripts/dev/CI | Launch/setup, Poe/hooks, runners, walkthroughs/evaluators/reports and artifacts | Read-only inventory |
| 9 Cross-module tests/docs | Shared fixtures/guards, dependencies, canonical truth/navigation and coverage gaps | Pending |

Each module includes its callers, tests and related scripts. Domain UI belongs to its domain module;
shared UI belongs to module 7. Script infrastructure has a separate complete review in module 8.
Assign every tracked file to a module (or an explicit retained static/vendor asset group); count and
resolve uncovered files before final review. Generated files are not production inspection evidence.

### Per-module procedure and closure

1. Read owned implementation/tests; trace entry points, authoritative state, mutation/publication,
   async lifecycle and consumers. Record deletion/consolidation candidates and concrete retain reasons.
2. Obtain passing behavior characterization before refactors; reproduce bugs before fixing them.
   Measure only suspected redundant work/waits and their directly relevant paths.
3. Make small deletion/reuse-first changes. Do not replace wrappers with another owner or move code
   solely to reduce file size. Update this plan before each new coherent slice.
4. Improve behavior evidence before removing weak/obsolete tests. Important side effects need a
   lower-mock internal workflow; keep valid external/native isolation. Check selected high-risk tests
   with a bounded intentional behavior break. Preserve known regression cases.
5. An independent non-author reviewer examines actual source/diff/callers/evidence and audit coverage;
   the main agent inspects the resulting diff/evidence. Fix blocking in-scope findings and re-review.

Closure requires complete file responsibility/disposition, resolved confirmed in-scope redundancy,
credible normal/failure/cancel behavior protection and explicit independent review approval. Unknown
in-scope items are not done. Public-contract/visible-behavior decisions require user input; continue
independent authorized work. Later shared-boundary edits reopen only affected module evidence.

### Validation and final endpoint

Focused checks per slice; widen early for shared state/data/publication/lifecycle risk. Preserve the
existing 85% line coverage gate and branch evidence without shrinking the denominator. Select commands
from the existing validation contract/runner; do not create another test-selection or gate framework.

After all modules close, independently review cross-module integration and inventory completeness.
Freeze a final exact commit and require applicable same-head CI, source-diverse data, platform/UI and
affected real-model Assistant evidence. Reuse equivalent successful CI; fill only missing local evidence.
Keep the Assistant's accepted bounded limitations; this stage is not Stable promotion.

Required scenarios include failed import retaining prior data, old recipe/result reading, processing
and split semantics, training stop/rerun, saliency completion/cancel/SmoothGrad/recompute/selector changes,
stale work rejected, Assistant confirmation/failure recovery and runtime shutdown/resource release.
Scripts additionally need honest exit/output outcomes, rerun behavior and safe cleanup boundaries.

Only after all closure conditions pass, deliver one Windows native GUI with its PowerShell live log
(no separate Live Log window), exact source and restart command, consolidated manual checklist, measured
changes and limitations. Confirm responsiveness, then hand control to the user. A slice, commit,
compaction or pending CI is not a stopping condition. Genuine authority/resource blockers are reported.
Manual findings receive affected/adjacent revalidation and an updated delta checklist, not automatic
whole-suite human retesting. Merge only after explicit final-source acceptance and permission.

### Current slice / next step

Recovery verified product branch `cleanup/module-quality` clean at `323241a9` (33 commits after
baseline `4770b049`). The original checkout's UI/test/settings changes remain intact. Recheck Git
after reboot; old session IDs are not running-work evidence. Completed 2I–2M and 8B are indexed below.

**Completed 2N — unused metadata readers/projection alias.** Main fully read metadata.py (735 lines),
direct metadata tests and actual scan/cache consumers. Independent caller/dynamic/config/serializer
audit confirms BidsMetadataReadBudget.read and _read_json_object have no callers; the
DATASET_DESCRIPTION_MAX_BYTES alias has only one test caller. Actual materialization uses
_read_bids_dataset_description -> parsed_json_value with admitted guards and the retained budget
fields, remaining_bytes and to_diagnostics. Delete only those unused methods/alias; migrate the
existing bounded-read test to BIDS_METADATA_READ_BUDGET_BYTES without weakening its assertions.

Preserve current byte caps/accounting, parsed-content freshness, containment, callbacks and
metadata/recipe field serialization. MetadataFieldResolution.to_dict remains: actual review calls
item.subject.to_dict. Main owns metadata.py/direct test only. Original metadata+parsed-cache suites
and selected actual scan admission/budget cases, migrated characterization before deletion, identical
after, Ruff and independent review; no new owner/API, visible UI or EEG/public schema changes.
Native original, migrated characterization and after selection each passed 27 cases (2.85/2.84/2.87s).
Ruff/format and independent actual-diff review passed; production -30 lines, no owner change.
Committed as `2a61245b`; continue module-2 review/candidate consolidation audit.

**Completed 2O — review projection helper consolidation.** Main read all review source (842 lines)
and direct tests (499 lines), plus searched actual public preview/service/UI consumers. `_raw_paths`
and `_path_values` implement identical ordered nonempty stripped path deduplication; use `_raw_paths`
for recipe diff rows as well as remap options and remove `_path_values`. Remove the private
`_target_step_for_text` forwarding alias and call the existing shared public routing function at
its three internal callers. Keep all visible wording, decision/identity validation and projections.
No UI file edit, new owner, schema or public-contract change; pure deletion/reuse in one source file.
Before deletion strengthen the existing recipe-preview characterization with duplicate/blank/None
path inputs for both EEG and labels, proving unchanged public diff/remap output. Run direct review,
candidate and recipe suites before and after, Ruff and independent actual-diff review; reversible
commit then continue remaining module2. Candidate one-use forwarder remains a separate next slice.
Original/strengthened-before-production/after native review+candidate+recipe selection each passed
80 cases (3.41/3.32/3.27s); Ruff/format and independent actual-diff review pass.
Production +8/-23/net -15, unchanged owners.

Placement source/direct tests were independently read (972/429 lines). Retain trial-order, time,
interval, event-code and committed-scope admission rules. Follow up event-code/interval branch evidence:
reviewer is checking existing downstream tests before declaring a gap. Main noticed interval may
overwrite a time-field `needs_review` with `ready` when duration count matches but onset count does not.
Reviewer traced real TSV plan -> wrong ready -> atomic apply fails nonnumeric onset without mutation.
Existing candidate tests cover normal interval and event-code ready/repeated/conflict; they do not
cover partial onset. User confirmation requested asynchronously because correcting ready changes
visible state. Do not change this product behavior until approved; other authorized work continues.

**Remaining read-only audits / next scope decisions.**

- Candidate/choice-schema source (1348/303 lines), all candidate tests (2518 lines, 56 cases) and
  event-value candidate/schema tests (342 lines) were fully read independently. Retain real temporary
  filesystem/format tests and external event-reader isolation. A one-use missing-files forwarder
  is a candidate only; underlying path resolver has two real consumers and must remain.
- Scan source (1493 lines) and all direct tests (1245 lines, 38 cases) were independently read.
  Preserve explicit-vs-recursive source selection, no-payload discovery then admitted materialization,
  shared budgets, identity/link guards and BIDS index traversal interfaces. No confirmed deletion.
- Metadata/pairing: retain the single shared pairing policy used by candidate, apply and UI.
  Subject-catalog wrapper is not deleted for module count: optional-index freshness/rebuild and
  error normalization remain useful. Label-carrier cache vs streaming fallback and BIDS multi-run
  suggestions have distinct evidence contracts, not duplicate class policy.
- BIDS index/parsed cache/channels/events-reader full source audits preserve distinct registry,
  command freshness, admitted-byte/provenance and atomic MNE mutation responsibilities. Inventory
  records exact full/partial test reads; no dataset-certification claim.
- Module 8 actual aggregation is already slim: it installs only lock-derived coverage, not the full
  product environment. Shards/platform/data/UI lanes provide non-equivalent evidence; retain gates.
  No measured unnecessary wait was established. Launcher/Poe/CI routing audit is only partial
  module coverage: workflow, run_tests, Windows bootstrap and their test bodies still need complete
  reading where inventory says partial. Do not claim all scripts reviewed.
- Continue import event/value/placement, BIDS/montage, metadata and related UI audit. Modules 3–9
  still require their complete per-module closure and final integration evidence.

There is no manual candidate or merge request. Completed slices, context recovery and pending gates
are not an endpoint; continue the next unfinished authorized step.

**Completed 2P — remove import-event identity-only branches.** Independent full candidate/internal-event
audits and main inspected changed caller graphs confirm two no-op layers: candidate's one-call
`_selected_files_missing_from_scan` forwards unchanged to the already-shared `_paths_missing_from_scan`;
internal `_looks_like_prefixed_marker` only returns the same nonempty string as the following branch.
Main removes only these no-ops after passing candidate/lifecycle characterization. Preserve both
the shared missing-path policy and all marker text/spacing/numeric normalization/semantic rules.
One reversible import-event simplification commit, no owners/schema/visible behavior change.

Before source edits, an independent worker owns only test_data_interpretation_reader_lifecycle.py
to add a tiny real saved FIF annotation+stim fixture through build_internal_event_preview, checking
marker spacing/numeric normalization and annotation priority, plus stim-only fallback if coherent.
Existing candidate tests do exercise description normalization after their mocked reader payload;
they do not exercise actual MNE dispatch/priority. Keep their assertions and the reader-failure-close
case. Main runs added characterization against unchanged production, then identical after plus native
Ruff/format and non-author review. No new environment, downloaded fixture or production test seam.
Native original 59 passed3.30s; added characterization before deletion61 passed3.50s; identical after
61 passed3.54s. The real stim reader emits an upstream MNE/NumPy deprecation warning (not failure).
Main reviewed actual test/diff; independent non-author review and Ruff/format passed.
Production +1/-22/net -21, unchanged owners. Commit separately from 2Q.

**Parallel 2Q — montage promotion retry characterization, tests only.** Independent audit read all
preparation/coordinator/lifecycle sources (1282/460/355 lines), direct tests (809/630 lines) and real
fixture integration test (130 lines). Keep distinct geometry/resource admission, generation/manual
precedence, and worker/publication responsibilities. Existing real geometry tests and deterministic
async seam isolation are useful. Confirmed uncovered transition: refresh_candidate failure retains
_retry_candidate; a later ApplicationService command calls retry_promotion. Worker owns only
test_bids_montage_coordinator.py: add a deterministic failed-refresh -> retained pending -> successful
retry -> no duplicate publication test using actual coordinator/lifecycle and existing parser seam.
No source changes or new control owner. Main reads patch and runs focused native suite and reviews
whether the assertion actually protects publication/retry, then independent review and separate commit.
This is added behavior evidence, not a claim real-fixture/Windows UI handoff has passed.
Native coordinator suite18 passed1.79s; Ruff/format and independent review passed. This directly
protects coordinator retention/promotion, not separate service-level stale-publication recovery dispatch.

### Responsibility closure and retained boundaries

- Module 1: independent reviewer approved shared-spine responsibility closure at `1247cf7c`.
  Native same-source selection: 178 passed, covering runtime/cache, confirmation, publication/delivery,
  owned work, state/read models, observer batching and actual query/shutdown cases. Service domain
  branches and state/snapshot projections remain explicit module 2–6 obligations. Later changes to
  shared identity/publication/lifecycle reopen affected evidence.
- The state-service test audit read all 2,063 lines / 49 functions: retain distinct failure, detachment
  and retry contracts. Actual data_lists cases already protect nonwaiting lock rejection,
  stale-generation admission and committed-state reads; do not invent another concurrency owner.
- Results, automation, pipeline-transaction and workflow-projection test audit read 1,761 lines:
  retain privacy/public-JSON, real command/subprocess, mutation-port and fail-closed behavior.
- Module 2: content identity source (1,010 lines) and direct/hash-cancel tests (945 lines) retain
  streaming SHA, path scope, admitted digest reuse, bounded workers and owned-context cancellation.
  PathIdentity lexical/resolved matching and parser-window ResourceReader checks protect different
  boundaries from cross-review SHA; they are not redundant caches.
- Recipe source/direct tests retain save/replay, legacy class-map migration into unconfirmed
  suggestions and current label-audit reconstruction. Target provenance/schema additions are not
  current guarantees or authorized schema work.
- Loader orchestration/factory/registration and direct tests have been read. Native installed MNE
  source refuted the proposed Raw lazy-handle leak: relevant Raw readers reopen paths per read,
  while EpochsFIF legitimately retains its live descriptor. Do not add a disposal owner without
  evidence. No measured startup/performance improvement is claimed.
- Study convenience cleanup does not certify training/domain methods. EvalRecord.export_csv remains
  a module-5 caller/disposition question, not a claim of reachable product CSV export.
- Module 6 must close the actual Assistant attempt -> pending confirmation -> application workflow
  evidence gap; separately tested halves do not prove stale approval rejects with exactly one
  authorized mutation. Preserve accepted bounded Assistant limitations, not Stable promotion.
- Module 8 initial inventory: 106 scripts, 66,204 physical lines. This is not deep-review evidence.
  Current CI routing correction covers only helpers actually used by visual lanes; separate handoff
  producers are not grounds for extra unrelated CI waits.

### Completed slices — compact recovery index

Each entry was inspected by the main agent and independently reviewed unless a limitation is stated.
These focused counts are not additive whole-project evidence. Owners/public contracts did not increase.
Detailed scope declarations and chronological corrections remain in the associated Git history;
this table replaces their duplicated active-plan narrative, not any unresolved module obligation.

### Evidence qualifications that remain relevant

- Use a fresh unique PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX plus -B for Windows tests of WSL-edited source: -B alone
  prevents writes, not stale reads. The earlier ambiguous 1B run was superseded by fresh-cache 84.
  No new environment was installed; an attempted Poetry environment lookup was abandoned.
- 2G had no original unedited chronological two-file baseline. Migrated tests before production
  deletion passed 81, but an environment-assignment warning invalidated its cache-isolation claim.
  Fresh-cache current runs passed 81; nested isolation was strengthened to mutate actual nested input.
  Final strengthened tests then passed 82 against exact historical `1247cf7c` state source loaded only
  in memory and 82 against current source. The first historical harness needed correct inspect
  linecache registration; that was a harness fix, not a product failure.
- 2G actual post-publication retirement failure now includes prior real apply/save and verifies
  interpretation identity, recipe ID/path/full content and pipeline/trainer/history restoration.
  It intentionally isolates internal transaction rollback with admission bypasses; normal policy
  blocks replacing data after training. A manually injected trainer fixture first caused stale
  Scan admission (combined 130 pass / 13 skip / 1 fail); publishing that injection through get_state
  fixed the fixture, and the corrected case plus full 82-case selection passed. Recipe carried into
  prepared state means recipe assertions alone do not prove rollback; restored interpretation ID does.
- 2H same retained Raw/loader/preprocess selection is 116 passed: one no-op case removed, four extra
  event-wipe parameter cases added. All passed within the combined run above. Thirteen skips are
  unconfigured external public fixtures, not checked-in GDF/multiformat cases; the final canonical
  source-diverse gate is still required. Replacing wipe with set_mne in memory caused all four
  imported-event cases to fail; no faulty source persisted. Existing MNE/NumPy warnings are not
  evidence of final whole-platform readiness.
- 2K's list/ndarray real Raw cases cover filtered interleaving, nonzero first sample, previous-value
  column, exact code/order and no source mutation before apply. Mismatch covers both directions.
  The isolated reversed-row probe failed both cases on timestamps/prior values; no faulty source
  persisted. The first argv probe had only a Windows quoting SyntaxError. One existing MNE warning
  in normal suites is expected all-epochs-dropped safety behavior, not a new failure.
- 2J's force_import field belonged to the explicitly internal LabelImportPlan recipe DTO; current
  construction/serialization never used it. Actual DatasetStateService.apply_labels_batch and
  checked atomic ownership remain. 2M's limit=20 belonged only to its discarded test-only convenience,
  not the current preview/public class-map policy. No formal contract changes are implied.
- Lower-mock internal paths retain external MNE/resource isolation where necessary. No reduced test
  count or path-only inventory establishes stronger workflow coverage by itself.

### Inventory and separate infrastructure recovery

The ignored static inventory is `build/dev-artifacts/module-quality-audit/tracked-files.md`,
initially 1,292 tracked files. Update disposition from actual source/caller/test reading; pending
remains unknown. Reconcile newly added/deleted files and domain-owned ranges before final closure.
Do not create a second planning platform or treat generated files as inspected production.

Authorized storage cleanup is complete locally: removed only abandoned backup
`E:\XBrainLabBackups\XBrainLab-WslCompaction-20260909-232646-9134c3e5810d4399b274695a2b546bce\Ubuntu-24.04-ext4.vhdx.bak`
and its empty parent, plus verified empty runs ending
`20260910-011228-93f0770cd28e49afb965485b587f3763` and
`20260910-014659-d5c3910b070c4a3ba2b6877f5734369d`.
E free bytes increased 712835555328 -> 927430828032 (214595272704 bytes, about 199.86 GiB).
Deletion is not recycle-bin recoverable. Both registered C WSL VHDXs, Windows Python, model/RAG caches
and central datasets remain. No C shrink, compaction, shutdown or deregistration ran.

Compaction-only source tooling withdrawal is separately committed `acf7c56d` on
`chore/manual-environment` in the infrastructure worktree; 84 retained native scripts tests passed.
An initial MAXPATH failure was resolved by the existing short cache temp path. Exact deployed
`D:\XBrainLabCache\tools\compact_wsl.ps1` matched retired source SHA-256
`6675b7debb8f02fc163ba1efed2eaff0d89afa632cd388329bff3935af73d0f5` and was removed.
Both manual launch tools remain. Source is recoverable from Git. No push/merge or manual-checkout
update is implied; inspect current Git/PR state before eventual integration.

### Recovery after context compaction

Read this whole active plan, Git status/diff/worktrees and current worker/session state first. Continue
the next unfinished authorized step immediately; a recovery summary is not an endpoint. Preserve the
module table, current slice, exact evidence and outstanding reviewer findings here before context loss.
Do not dispatch from older completed PRs, recreate environments, discard active work or stop because a
single slice has passed. Keep this file the sole active plan until the stage is actually complete.
