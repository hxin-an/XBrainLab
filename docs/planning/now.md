## Delivery — retained Windows import; manual acceptance pending

Implementation is complete at product/evidence source
`b7cd120631e41416063cb9933c9a070d45b68323` on PR #141. Retained recording/root coverage,
normal Windows routes, recovery and same-source CI have passed; exact counts, source boundaries
and the preserved Thielen timing limitation belong to [Current](../current.md).
The completed construction history remains in Git/PR and the E-drive evidence archive, not active
dispatch. Do not restart those campaigns after context compaction.

Only delivery remains: validate the documentation-only closure commit, confirm it leaves product,
scripts, dependencies and tests unchanged from the verified candidate, then open the existing shared
Windows environment with one PowerShell live log. The E-drive location guide is the manual entrypoint;
provide one focused checklist, not 134 repeated human tests. Stop after the app is responsive and the
manual handoff is delivered; no further monitoring of the user's operations.

User manual acceptance and explicit merge approval remain pending. Do not merge, remove the worktree,
delete original data/evidence or create environments/models. Any new reachable defect is diagnosed
within its approved boundary; visible UI changes still require concrete confirmation.
The separate Assistant candidate below is not authorized implementation in this delivery.

## Closed baseline

Quality-baseline closure was accepted and merged via
[PR #140](https://github.com/hxin-an/XBrainLab/pull/140). Its implementation/evidence history stays in
Git/PR, not active dispatch. Known Assistant limitations below remain deferred.

## Candidate — Assistant reliability repair plan (not active implementation)

Goal: reliable selection and parameter-collection continuity with no unexpected workflow side effects.
LOC, static pass, literal prompt assertions or one improved score are not completion criteria.

1. **Mechanism audit before choosing a fix.** Trace baseline/retained failures from full rendered input/
   RAG through raw output, parser, capability/provenance, typed receipt, GUI terminal and visible response.
   Separate intent errors, missing clarification fields, invalid/stale admission and evaluator assumptions.
   Reproduce a bounded set through normal ChatPanel with real execution, using no patient data.
   No Host intent guessing or new model experiments in this diagnostic phase.
2. **Approve a repair boundary.** Select one evidence-backed hypothesis and existing owner. Explicitly
   decide behavior for unspecified/multiple actions, missing/partial values, correction/cancel and
   unavailable tools. Tool/schema/confirmation/visible-flow or model/RAG changes require separate
   approval; current source/tests do not ratify target. A larger model is neither proven necessary nor
   authorized. No generic evaluator platform, control plane or parallel state owner.
3. **Separate development and acceptance.** Keep frozen 81/scorer unchanged as regression evidence.
   Before implementation, define supplementary development cases and disjoint reviewer-owned holdout
   by failure family. Never tune on the holdout or shrink its denominator; disclose prior exposure to
   frozen cases. Reuse existing runners, review any necessary bounded extension, and agree a candidate/
   resource budget before execution. Do not repeatedly add two more prompt attempts after failure.
4. **Implement/review one coherent repair.** Prefer deletion/reuse; test failing observable behavior
   through actual owners, then passing behavior. Mock external inference only in unit tests; real-model/
   native evidence cannot substitute fake generation or preapproved GUI terminals. Independent reviewer
   checks mechanism, meaningful tests, complexity and scope, not only summary.
5. **One integrated acceptance.** Require 36/36 positive, 10/10 explicit origin, 5/5 missing guards,
   5/5 direct clarification admission, 24/24 product no-action and 7/7 clarification. Holdout must show
   zero unexpected execution/confirmation/navigation/mutation and correct authorized continuations.
   Separate raw-model/Host/product outcomes. Then same-source normal ChatPanel→GUI→Command journey,
   relevant cancel/stale cleanup, applicable CI and one final Windows GUI/English Assistant acceptance.
   No Stable/generalized-safety claim from bounded cases alone. Unsupported mechanism or exhausted
   budget means a documented decision checkpoint, not weaker gates or automatic extra prompt edits.

This proposal does not block the explicitly revised cleanup scope or certify Assistant readiness.
New implementation begins only after diagnostic outcome, scope and budget are approved.
